# Xylophone

Learning Flutter and dart at appbrewery.co

Xylophone is a music app that plays Xylophone sounds.

During this project I was thought:

* How to incorporate open source libraries of code into a project using Flutter Packages.
* How to play sound on both iOS and Android.
* How to generate repeated user interface Widgets.
* How to use Dart functions that can take input arguments as well as return an output.
* Dart arrow syntax for writing one line functions.
